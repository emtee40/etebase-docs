As explained in [the overview](../overview.md), collections have types, and these types indicate what the content of the collection is and how it should be handled.

Some apps will have their own custom collection type that is very specific to their needs, though in most cases, apps can just use one of the predefined type specs.

This section is a list of these common type specifications and more information about them.
If your app uses a type specification that you think should be added to this list, please open a pull request, and we will be happy to add it.
